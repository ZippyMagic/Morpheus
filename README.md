# Morpheus - Innovating virus, malware, and trojans since 2017!
 Morpheus is a revolutionary virus for Windows 10.  It currently is in a early stage of development.
 

 - Opens many programs and acts like a "virus".
 - Randomly moves the mouse.
 - Deletes an important file for starting up windows.
 - Blocks some websites.

 - More or less destroy's users experience.
 
 Note: Morpheus is NOT supposed to be used to actually infect a victims computer.  It is ONLY to be used for educational purposes.  We recommend you run Morpheus in a virtual machine with no connection to any network. If you do not do this, you have a chance of infecting every computer in the world, and it is NOT OUT FAULT IF THIS HAPPENS. Thank you.
 
 ```js
 function Morpheus(filestream) {
   return filestream.toString().slice(1).substr(3).split("&")[3];
 }
 
 console.log(Morpheus('{hi: \'sup\', lol: \'XD\'}${ZippyMagician: \'awesome\'}'));
 ```
